Terraform Provider for ☁️Zscaler Private Access☁️
=========================================================================

- [Website](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/zscaler/zpa/latest)
- [Documentation](https://help.zscaler.com/zpa)
- [Zscaler Community](https://community.zscaler.com)

## Support Disclaimer

-> **Disclaimer:** Please refer to our [General Support Statement](docs/guides/support.md) before proceeding with the use of this provider. You can also refer to our [troubleshooting guide](docs/guides/troubleshooting.md) for guidance on typical problems.

Requirements
------------

- Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12.x/0.13.x/0.14.x/0.15.x (0.11.x or lower is incompatible)
- Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.16+ (This will be used to build the provider plugin.)
- Create a directory, go, follow this [doc](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) to edit ~/.bash_profile to setup the GOPATH environment variable)

Building The Provider (Terraform v0.12+)
---------------------

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-zpa`

```sh
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
git clone https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-zpa.git
```

To clone on windows

```sh
mkdir %GOPATH%\src\github.com\terraform-providers
cd %GOPATH%\src\github.com\terraform-providers
git clone https://github.com/zscaler/terraform-provider-zpa.git
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-zpa
make fmt
make build
```

To build on Windows

```sh
cd %GOPATH%\src\github.com\terraform-providers\terraform-provider-zpa
go fmt
go install
```

Building The Provider (Terraform v0.13+)
-----------------------

### MacOS / Linux

Run the following command:

```sh
make build13
```

### Windows

Run the following commands for cmd:

```sh
cd %GOPATH%\src\github.com\terraform-providers\terraform-provider-zpa
go fmt
go install
xcopy "%GOPATH%\bin\terraform-provider-zpa.exe" "%APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins\zscaler.com\zpa\zpa\2.0.5\windows_amd64\" /Y
```

Run the following commands if using powershell:

```sh
cd "$env:GOPATH\src\github.com\terraform-providers\terraform-provider-zpa"
go fmt
go install
xcopy "$env:GOPATH\bin\terraform-provider-zpa.exe" "$env:APPDATA\terraform.d\plugins\zscaler.com\zpa\zpa\2.0.5\windows_amd64\" /Y
```

**Note**: For contributions created from forks, the repository should still be cloned under the `$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-zpa` directory to allow the provided `make` commands to properly run, build, and test this project.

Using Zscaler Private Access Provider (Terraform v0.12+)
-----------------------

Activate the provider by adding the following to `~/.terraformrc` on Linux/Unix.

```sh
providers {
  "zpa" = "$GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-zpa"
}
```

For Windows, the file should be at '%APPDATA%\terraform.rc'. Do not change $GOPATH to %GOPATH%.

In Windows, for terraform 0.11.8 and lower use the above text.

In Windows, for terraform 0.11.9 and higher use the following at '%APPDATA%\terraform.rc'

```sh
providers {
  "zpa" = "$GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-zpa.exe"
}
```

If the rc file is not present, it should be created

Using Zscaler Private Access Provider (Terraform v0.13+)
-----------------------

For Terraform v0.13+, to use a locally built version of a provider you must add the following snippet to every module
that you want to use the provider in.

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    zpa = {
      source  = "zscaler.com/zpa/zpa"
      version = "2.0.5"
    }
  }
}
```

Issues
=========

Please feel free to open an issue using [Github Issues](https://github.com/zscaler/terraform-provider-zpa/issues) if you run into any problems using this ZPA Terraform provider.

Developing the Provider
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.16+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-zpa
...
```

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
make testacc
```
