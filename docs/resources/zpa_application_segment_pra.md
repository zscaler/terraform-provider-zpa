# Resource: zpa_application_segment_pra

The **zpa_application_segment_pra** resource creates an application segment for Privileged Remote Access in the Zscaler Private Access cloud. This resource can then be referenced in an access policy rule, access policy timeout rule, access policy client forwarding rule and inspection policy. This resource supports Privileged Remote Access for both `RDP` and `SSH`.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "zpa_application_segment_pra" "this" {
  name             = "PRA_Example"
  description      = "PRA_Example"
  enabled          = true
  health_reporting = "ON_ACCESS"
  bypass_type      = "NEVER"
  is_cname_enabled = true
  tcp_port_ranges  = ["22", "22", "3389", "3389"]
  domain_names     = ["ssh_pra.example.com", "rdp_pra.example.com"]
  segment_group_id = zpa_segment_group.this.id
  server_groups {
    id = [zpa_server_group.this.id]
  }
  common_apps_dto {
    apps_config {
      name                 = "ssh_pra"
      domain               = "ssh_pra.example.com"
      application_protocol = "SSH"
      application_port     = "22"
      enabled = true
      app_types = [ "SECURE_REMOTE_ACCESS" ]
    }
    apps_config {
    name                 = "rdp_pra"
    domain               = "rdp_pra.example.com"
    application_protocol = "RDP"
    connection_security  = "ANY"
    application_port     = "3389"
    enabled = true
    app_types = [ "SECURE_REMOTE_ACCESS" ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name. The name of the App Connector Group to be exported.
* `domain_names` - (Required) List of domains and IPs.
* `server_groups` - (Required) List of Server Group IDs
* `segment_group_id` - (Required) List of Segment Group IDs
* `common_apps_dto` - (Required) List of applications (e.g., Inspection, Browser Access or Privileged Remote Access)
  * `apps_config:` - (Required) List of applications to be configured
    * `name` - (Required) Name of the Privileged Remote Access
    * `domain` - (Required) Domain name of the Privileged Remote Access
    * `application_protocol` - (Required) Protocol for the Privileged Remote Access. Supported values: `RDP` and `SSH`
    * `application_port` - (Required) Port for the Privileged Remote Access
    * `app_types` - (Required) Indicates the type of application as Privileged Remote Access. Supported value: `SECURE_REMOTE_ACCESS`
    * `connection_security` - (Required) - Parameter required when `application_protocol` is of type `RDP`
    * `enabled` - (Optional) Whether this application is enabled or not
* `tcp_port_ranges` - (Required) TCP port ranges used to access the app.
* `udp_port_ranges` - (Required) UDP port ranges used to access the app.

-> **NOTE:**  TCP and UDP ports can also be defined using the following model:
-> **NOTE:** When removing TCP and/or UDP ports, parameter must be defined but set as empty due to current API behavior.

* `tcp_port_range` - (Required) TCP port ranges used to access the app.
  * `from:`
  * `to:`
* `udp_port_range` - (Required) UDP port ranges used to access the app.
  * `from:`
  * `to:`

-> **NOTE:** Application segments must have unique ports and cannot have overlapping domain names using the same tcp/udp ports across multiple application segments.

## Attributes Reference

* `description` - (Optional) Description of the application.
* `bypass_type` - (Optional) Indicates whether users can bypass ZPA to access applications.
* `config_space` - (Optional)
* `double_encrypt` - (Optional) Whether Double Encryption is enabled or disabled for the app.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Whether this application is enabled or not.
* `health_reporting` - (Optional) Whether health reporting for the app is Continuous or On Access. Supported values: NONE, ON_ACCESS, CONTINUOUS.
* `health_check_type` (Optional)
* `icmp_access_type` - (Optional)
* `ip_anchored` - (Optional)
* `is_cname_enabled` - (Optional) Indicates if the Zscaler Client Connector (formerly Zscaler App or Z App) receives CNAME DNS records from the connectors.
* `tcp_keep_alive` (Optional) Supported values: ``1`` for Enabled and ``0`` for Disabled

* `microtenant_id` (Optional) The ID of the microtenant the resource is to be associated with.

⚠️ **WARNING:**: The attribute ``microtenant_id`` is optional and requires the microtenant license and feature flag enabled for the respective tenant. The provider also supports the microtenant ID configuration via the environment variable `ZPA_MICROTENANT_ID` which is the recommended method.

## Import

Zscaler offers a dedicated tool called Zscaler-Terraformer to allow the automated import of ZPA configurations into Terraform-compliant HashiCorp Configuration Language.
