* [API documentation](https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/configuring-appprotection-controls-using-api)

The **zpa_inspection_custom_controls** resource creates an inspection custom control. This resource can then be referenced in an inspection profile resource.

## Example - Inspection Custom Control - PASS Action

```terraform
resource "zpa_inspection_custom_controls" "this" {
  name           = "Example"
  description    = "Example"
  default_action = "PASS"
  paranoia_level = "1"
  severity       = "CRITICAL"
  type = "RESPONSE"
  rules {
    names = ["this"]
    type  = "RESPONSE_HEADERS"
    conditions {
      lhs = "SIZE"
      op  = "GE"
      rhs = "1000"
    }
  }
  rules {
    type  = "RESPONSE_BODY"
    conditions {
      lhs = "SIZE"
      op  = "GE"
      rhs = "1000"
    }
  }
}
```

## Example - Inspection Custom Control - BLOCK Action

```terraform
resource "zpa_inspection_custom_controls" "this" {
  name           = "Example"
  description    = "Example"
  default_action = "BLOCK"
  paranoia_level = "1"
  severity       = "CRITICAL"
  type = "RESPONSE"
  rules {
    names = ["this"]
    type  = "RESPONSE_HEADERS"
    conditions {
      lhs = "SIZE"
      op  = "GE"
      rhs = "1000"
    }
  }
  rules {
    type  = "RESPONSE_BODY"
    conditions {
      lhs = "SIZE"
      op  = "GE"
      rhs = "1000"
    }
  }
}
```

## Example - Inspection Custom Control - REDIRECT Action

```terraform
resource "zpa_inspection_custom_controls" "this" {
  name                      = "Example"
  description               = "Example"
  default_action            = "REDIRECT"
  default_action_value      = "https://test.com"
  paranoia_level            = "1"
  severity                  = "CRITICAL"
  type = "RESPONSE"
  rules {
    names = ["this"]
    type  = "RESPONSE_HEADERS"
    conditions {
      lhs = "SIZE"
      op  = "GE"
      rhs = "1000"
    }
  }
  rules {
    type  = "RESPONSE_BODY"
    conditions {
      lhs = "SIZE"
      op  = "GE"
