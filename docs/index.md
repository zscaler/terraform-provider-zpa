# Zscaler Private Access Provider (ZPA)

The Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) provider is used to interact with [ZPA](https://www.zscaler.com/products/zscaler-private-access) platform, to onboard new application segments, segment groups, server groups, and create zero trust access policies. To use this  provider, you must create ZPA API credentials. For details on API credentials, please visit the official product [help portal](https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/about-api-keys)

Use the navigation on the left to read about the available resources.

## Support Disclaimer

-> **Disclaimer:** Please refer to our [General Support Statement](guides/support.md) before proceeding with the use of this provider. You can also refer to our [troubleshooting guide](guides/troubleshooting.md) for guidance on typical problems.

## Zscaler OneAPI New Framework

The ZPA Terraform Provider now offers support for [OneAPI](https://help.zscaler.com/oneapi/understanding-oneapi) Oauth2 authentication through [Zidentity](https://help.zscaler.com/zidentity/what-zidentity).

**NOTE** As of version v4.0.0, this Terraform provider offers backwards compatibility to the Zscaler legacy API framework. This is the recommended authentication method for organizations whose tenants are still not migrated to [Zidentity](https://help.zscaler.com/zidentity/what-zidentity). 

**NOTE** Notice that OneAPI and Zidentity is not currently supported for the following clouds: `GOV` and `GOVUS`. Refer to the [Legacy API Framework](#legacy-api-framework) for more information on how authenticate to these environments

[![ZPA Terraform provider Video Series Ep1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zscaler/terraform-provider-zpa/master/images/zpa_terraform_provider_introduction.svg)](https://community.zscaler.com/zenith/s/question/0D54u00009evlEpCAI/video-zpa-terraform-provider-video-series-ep1)

## Examples Usage - Client Secret Authentication

```hcl
# Configure the Zscaler Private Access Provider
terraform {
    required_providers {
        zpa = {
            version = "~> 4.0.0"
            source = "zscaler/zpa"
        }
    }
}

# Configure the ZPA Provider (OneAPI Authentication)
#
# NOTE: Change place holder values denoted by brackets to real values, including
# the brackets.
#
# NOTE: If environment variables are utilized for provider settings the
# corresponding variable name does not need to be set in the provider config
# block.
provider "zpa" {
  client_id = "[ZSCALER_CLIENT_ID]"
  client_secret = "[ZSCALER_CLIENT_SECRET]"
  vanity_domain = "[ZSCALER_VANITY_DOMAIN]"
  zscaler_cloud = "[ZSCALER_CLOUD]"
  zpa_customer_id = "[ZPA_CUSTOMER_ID]"
}
```

## Examples Usage - Private Key Authentication

```hcl
# Configure the Zscaler Private Access Provider
terraform {
    required_providers {
        zpa = {
            version = "~> 4.0.0"
            source = "zscaler/zpa"
        }
    }
}

# Configure the ZPA Provider (OneAPI Authentication) - Private Key
#
# NOTE: Change place holder values denoted by brackets to real values, including
# the brackets.
#
# NOTE: If environment variables are utilized for provider settings the
# corresponding variable name does not need to be set in the provider config
# block.
provider "zpa" {
  client_id     = "[ZSCALER_CLIENT_ID]"
  private_key   = "[ZSCALER_PRIVATE_KEY]"
  vanity_domain = "[ZSCALER_VANITY_DOMAIN]"
  zscaler_cloud = "[ZSCALER_CLOUD]"
  zpa_customer_id = "[ZPA_CUSTOMER_ID]"
}
```

**NOTE**: The `zscaler_cloud` is optional and only required when authenticating to other environments i.e `beta`

⚠️ **WARNING:** Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not recommended, and risks secret leakage should this file be committed to public version control

## Authentication - OneAPI New Framework

As of version v4.0.0, this provider supports authentication via the new Zscaler API framework [OneAPI](https://help.zscaler.com/oneapi/understanding-oneapi)

Zscaler OneAPI uses the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework to provide secure access to Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) APIs. OAuth 2.0 allows third-party applications to obtain controlled access to protected resources using access tokens. OneAPI uses the Client Credentials OAuth flow, in which client applications can exchange their credentials with the authorization server for an access token and obtain access to the API resources, without any user authentication involved in the process.

* [ZPA API](https://help.zscaler.com/oneapi/understanding-oneapi#:~:text=Workload%20Groups-,ZPA%20API,-Zscaler%20Private%20Access)

### OneAPI (API Client Scope)

OneAPI Resources are automatically created within the ZIdentity Admin UI based on the RBAC Roles
applicable to APIs within the various products. For example, in ZPA, navigate to `Administration -> Role
Management` and select `Add API Role`.

Once this role has been saved, return to the ZIdentity Admin UI and from the Integration menu
select API Resources. Click the `View` icon to the right of Zscaler APIs and under the ZIA
dropdown you will see the newly created Role. In the event a newly created role is not seen in the
ZIdentity Admin UI a `Sync Now` button is provided in the API Resources menu which will initiate an
on-demand sync of newly created roles.

### Default Environment variables

You can provide credentials via the `ZSCALER_CLIENT_ID`, `ZSCALER_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ZSCALER_VANITY_DOMAIN`, `ZSCALER_CLOUD` environment variables, representing your Zidentity OneAPI credentials `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `vanityDomain` and `zscaler_cloud` respectively.

### Zscaler Private Access Microtenant

A Microtenant is a delegated administrator responsibility that is assigned to an admin by an admin with Microtenant administrator privileges. Microtenants are defined by an authentication domain and assigned to admins based on country, department, and company for role-based administration control. A Microtenant is created within a tenant and is used when departments or subsidiaries within an organization want to manage their configurations independently.[Read More](https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/about-microtenants)

To manage a microtenant using the ZPA Terraform provider, the administrator for the parent or default tenant, must first provision the microtenant using the resource `zpa_microtenant_controller`. The resource will output the administrator credentials for the new microtenant, which can then be provided to the microtenant administrator.

The microtenant administrator can then create his own microtenant API credentials required to authenticate via API to the ZPA platform. From that point, the administrator can then individually manage his own resources in an isolated manner.
When authenticating to microtenant via API using the ZPA Terraform provider, the administrator must provide the following environment variable credentials: `ZPA_CLIENT_ID`, `ZPA_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ZPA_CUSTOMER_ID`, `ZPA_CLOUD`, `ZPA_MICROTENANT_ID`

~> **NOTE 1** Only environment variables are currently supported when authenticating to a Microtenant.

~> **NOTE 2** The environment variable `ZPA_MICROTENANT_ID` is mandatory when provisioning/managing resources exclusively within a Microtenant.

~> **NOTE 3** `ZPA_CLOUD` environment variable is an optional parameter when running this provider in production; however, this parameter is required to provision resources in the `BETA`, `GOV`, `GOVUS`, `PREVIEW` or `ZPATWO` clouds.
