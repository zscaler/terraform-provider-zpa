# Data Source: zpa_application_segment_pra

Use the **zpa_application_segment_pra** data source to get information about an application segment for Privileged Remote Access in the Zscaler Private Access cloud. This resource can then be referenced in an access policy rule, access policy timeout rule, access policy client forwarding rule and inspection policy. This resource supports Privileged Remote Access for both `RDP` and `SSH`.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# ZPA Application Segment Data Source
data "zpa_application_segment_pra" "this" {
  name = "PRA_Example"
}
```

```hcl
# ZPA Application Segment Data Source
data "zpa_application_segment_pra" "this" {
  id = "123456789"
}
```
